# Project Brief

## What am I building?

A backend authentication service built with Python and FastAPI. It will handle user authentication — registration, login, token management, and related auth flows — exposed as a REST API.

## Why?

To provide a standalone, reusable authentication layer that can be integrated with other services and frontends.

## For whom?

Other services and applications that need user authentication capabilities.

## Key Requirements

- User registration and login
- Token-based authentication (JWT)
- Secure password handling
- RESTful API endpoints

## Constraints (optional)

- **Tech stack**: Python / FastAPI

## Out of Scope

- Frontend / UI
- Authorization / permissions (for now — auth only)
